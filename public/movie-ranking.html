<h3>Star Wars - A Wew Hope</h3>
<p>This cemented my love of science fiction. </p>
<h3>Conan The Barbarian</h3>
<p>Arnold is the ultimate. Saw it in theatres with my dad! Very great memory for me. </p>
<h3>Pulp Fiction</h3>
<p>I love the camera angles and the dialogue. It's a cult classic. I love you hunny bunny!</p>
